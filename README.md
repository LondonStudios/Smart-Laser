# **Full Features**

**Laser Colours**  - You can set the RGBA colour of the laser as a default value, or give every weapon a different laser colour. The possibilities are endless.
**Custom Laser Position** - For each weapon you can easily define the laser offSet, to make sure it's appearing out of the gun in the right place.
**Keybind Mapped** - You can set a default keybind in the config that will register in every player's settings. They can then set their own keybind in Settings -> Keybinds -> FiveM.
**Laser Range** - Each weapon can have a custom laser range, for example you may want to extend this for assault rifles.

As you can see, we've got so many features, all aiming to enhance the roleplay experience for your server. This resource is easy to setup and configure so you should be up and running in no time.
